I'm Luka (also known as KockaAdmiralac), and this is my personal website. I am:

- a master student of Computer Science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/),
- the maintainer of [SI Wiki](https://siwiki.rs/)'s infrastructure and its
  founder,
- a wiki administrator on
  [Undertale](https://undertale.wiki/),
  [Deltarune](https://deltarune.wiki/),
  [Fandom Developers](https://dev.fandom.com/),
  [Undertale Yellow](https://undertaleyellow.wiki.gg/)
  and [many other](/about/#wikis) wikis,
- a lecturer, mentor and system administrator at [PFE](https://pfe.rs/),
- a Linux user, and
- a bullet point list enjoyer.

I'd like to write about what I'm doing here, but I rarely get the time. For now,
you have my [slightly more detailed About Me page](/about/), my
[interests](/interests/), and my other profiles which you can either find in the
sidebar or under the "Follow" button, depending on which device you're looking
from.

Cheers!
