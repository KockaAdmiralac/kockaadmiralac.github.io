Here's a collection of random facts about myself. Some of them were probably
more entertaining for me to write than for you to read.

## Basic information

- I'm male (he/him).
- I'm from Serbia, and currently living in Switzerland for studies.
- My aliases online are usually `KockaAdmiralac`, `Novica44`, and `perapisar`.
    - All of these are in Serbian, so the correct pronounciation of "c" is "ts",
      but people commonly mispronounce it. It should be KotskaAdmeeralats, not
      CockaAdmire-a-lack, but it's an honest mistake to make.
    - People also often mistake me for a Hungarian person. Sorry! It's not my fault that we ~~stole~~ incorporated the word 'kocka' into the Serbian dictionary from Hungarian.
    - When I create bot users, I usually name them `KockaBot`.

## Education

- I finished my Bachelor's in Software Engineering from the
  [School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade](https://etf.bg.ac.rs/)
  in September 2023.
    - During my time there, I founded [SI Wiki](https://siwiki.rs/), a
      collection of useful learning materials for software and computer
      engineering students at the faculty, which any student can contribute to.
      It turned out to be an invaluable resource for many, and I hope it keeps
      being useful for the years to come.
    - I also worked as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, helping the TAs
      during labs and some exams.
- I'm currently studying Computer Science at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/).
- I'm an associate at the
  [Science and Engineering Center PFE](https://pfe.rs/),
  which is a non-profit organization aiming to bring free scientific and
  engineering education to all motivated students in Serbia.
    - I have been at PFE's camps in 2018 and 2019 as a participant, and later
      joined as an associate.
    - Nowadays, I do system administration work (the website that you see above
      is actually my and [Parag](https://filiparag.com/)'s work) and
      participate at the camps as much as time (and location) allows.

## Wikis

- I started contributing to MediaWiki-based wikis in December 2015.
- My [first edit](https://undertale.fandom.com/?oldid=54368) was on December
  11, 2015 on the Undertale Wiki. I obtained my administrator rights on there
  [exactly a month later](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Log/rights?page=User:KockaAdmiralac),
  and the rest is history.
- I'm active and semi-active on the following wikis:
    - [Undertale Wiki](https://undertale.fandom.com/) (administrator),
    - [Deltarune Wiki](https://deltarune.fandom.com/) (bureaucrat),
    - [Fandom Developers Wiki (Dev Wiki)](https://dev.fandom.com/)
      (administrator),
    - [Undertale Yellow Wiki](https://undertaleyellow.wiki.gg/) (administrator),
    - [OneShot Wiki](https://oneshot.fandom.com/) (bureaucrat),
    - [Cave Story Wiki](https://cavestory.fandom.com/) (administrator),
    - [OFF Wiki](https://off.fandom.com/) (administrator),
    - [Dweller's Empty Path Wiki](https://dwellers-empty-path.fandom.com/)
      (bureaucrat),
    - [Escaped Chasm](https://escaped-chasm.fandom.com/) (just watching for
      vandalism),
    - [The Property of Hate Wiki](https://the-property-of-hate.fandom.com/)
      (just watching for vandalism),
    - and, of course, the aforementioned [SI Wiki](https://siwiki.rs/) which I
      founded and still help around.
- I used to be more involved with the global community at
  [Fandom](https://c.fandom.com/) when I was younger. These days, I usually help
  the wider community by reporting spam to the [SOAP](https://soap.fandom.com/)
  using [tools that I've built](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/KockaLogger),
  as well as helping users over at the Dev Wiki.
- I rarely
  [do anything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/KockaAdmiralac)
  on Wikipedia, but I used to
  [have fun](https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/KockaAdmiralac)
  reverting vandalism on the Serbo-Croatian Wikipedia once.

## Discord

- My preferred communication platform is [Discord](https://discord.com/), where
  my username is `kockaadmiralac`.
- If you send me a friend request out of nowhere, chances are I won't accept it.
  I'd at least have to know who you are.
- I'm usually around the Discord servers of wikis I administrate.

## Software

- I've been using Linux since 2014 as an operating system for my server, and
  since 2017 on my personal laptop. I started with
  [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), switched to
  [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) in 2019, and finally to
  [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) in 2020. I appreciate how much Linux
  makes my software development experience easier, Arch Linux's lack of bloat
  and very simple package management in comparison to other distributions.
- Software of choice:
    - Text editor and IDE: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Window manager: [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
    - Terminal emulator: [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
    - Image editing: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
    - Video and audio editing: [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
    - Music player: [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/)
    - File manager: [ranger](https://ranger.fm/)
    - Browser: [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)
    - Email client: [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/)
    - I realize this list is useful for targeting me with zero-day
      vulnerabilities and probably nothing else.

## Work

- My first two internships were at the [Petlja Foundation](https://petlja.org/)
  in 2019 and 2020. I worked on security, authentication, and on many features
  of their competition environment, [Arena](https://arena.petlja.org/).
- My next two internships were at the
  [Microsoft Development Center Serbia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-rs/mdcs).
    - First time I worked on integrating
      [math manipulatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulative_(mathematics_education))
      into PowerPoint Online and OneNote for desktop (this was an experiment
      that the team wanted to do, you will probably never see my work in
      production).
    - Second time I experimented with the effects of video compression on human
      body reconstruction for the
      [Microsoft Holoportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Holoportation)
      product.
- I helped complete the
  [port of OneShot to Linux](https://twitter.com/GIRakaCHEEZER/status/1120943159377190912).
  I'm not super happy about how it turned out, as I had no idea how packaging
  Linux apps is supposed to work and just packaged any libraries I thought would
  be needed, but everything else I contributed should be working as much as
  possible. (This was volunteer work.)

## Other

- I've completed elementary music education for piano (6 years). However, I
  don't really play the piano anymore.
