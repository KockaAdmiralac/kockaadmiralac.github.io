## Music

It's hard to put into words the kind of music I listen to. I guess I like some
chiptune, game soundtracks, symphonic metal, ex-Yugoslavian rock... but it'd be
the best if you take a sample of the music yourself. Below are listed all
sources online which I use to pull music onto my laptop whenever I feel like
listening to a days long playlist of music on shuffle.
